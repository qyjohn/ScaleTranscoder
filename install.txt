1. Need one RabbitMQ server running somewhere, allowing guest access from the clients. The easiest way to achieve this is to have the following line in /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config:

[{rabbit, [{loopback_users, []}]}].

2. To upload test data, with a report interval of 10 seconds:

java -cp target/transcoder-jar-with-dependencies.jar net.qyjohn.transcoder.PublishJobs jobs.txt upload 10000

3. To publish jobs, wiht a report interval of 10 seconds

java -cp target/transcoder-jar-with-dependencies.jar net.qyjohn.transcoder.PublishJobs jobs.txt transcode 10000


4. To process jobs:

java -cp target/transcoder-jar-with-dependencies.jar net.qyjohn.transcoder.Transcoder
